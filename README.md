# Dataset generator
## Usage

## Development
### VSCode
We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your development environment. Clone the repository and the default project settings should immediately apply.
Use the development container to open a preconfigured Python3.11 Docker container. You do not need to create a virtual environment (venv) as your packages are installed in the container.

If you want to add python packages, add them to the requirements.txt file.

Use the Data Wrangler extension in VSCode to inspect your DataFrames.

Happy coding!
